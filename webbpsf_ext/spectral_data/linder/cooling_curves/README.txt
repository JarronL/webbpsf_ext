COOLING CURVES

The filename:
The first number corresponds to the atmosphric model, -2 is for the petitCODE grid, -3 for the HELIOS grid.
Then the metallicity is given.
There are different models, clear and with clouds. If the model contains clouds, the settling parameter fsed is given.
The planetary mass in Earth masses is at the end of the filename.
For some masses, also brighter and fainter cases are calculated. These are named with a _brighter resp.  _fainter in the end.

The header:
The header repeats the file name information, it gives a conversion factor for the luminosity and the column names and units. All the magnitudes are in absolute magnitudes. 

In the files:
The planetary characteristics and magnitudes are given as long as the magnitudes can be calculated, which means as long as the planet is evolving in the logg-temperature of the atmospheric grid. For the cloudy grid, the magnitudes are calculated as long as the planet  is above 200 K.
