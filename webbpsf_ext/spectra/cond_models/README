In this directory you will find the precomputed grids of model atmosphere,
synthetic spectra, colors and isochrones, as well as the papers in which these
grids are published (http://phoenix.ens-lyon.fr/Grids/).  The BT and AMES in 
the names of the grids refer to the source of water vapor line list used in 
these models (BT stands for the Barber & Tennyson BT2 2006 line list, while 
AMES stands for the Partridge & Schwenke 1997 line list). The NextGen models 
used the preliminary water vapor line list by Schryber, Miller & Tennyson
1995. There is four different types of models below: the NextGen appellation 
is reserved for pure gas phase equilibrium models, the Dusty appellation
refers to models in which dust is formed is equilibrium with the gas phase 
(maximum dust content), the Cond appellation refers to Dusty models is which 
the dust opacity has been neglected to simulated a minimum dust content case, 
and finally the Settl appelation refers to models accounting for dust
formation via a paramater-free cloud model (base on the work by Rossow 1978). 
Relative to Dusty models, the latter models include among other microphysical 
processes, gravitational settling, which explains the choice of the Settl
label for these models.   

These models are provided for different solar abundance values from
different authors when available. CIFIST2011 stands for the Caffau et
al. (2011) values. AGSS2009 stands for the values by Asplund et
al. (2009). GAS2007 stands for the Grevesse, Asplund & Sauval (2007)
values. And GNS1993 stands for the original Grevesse, Noels & Sauval (1993)
values. However, the model grids do not differ by only the source of solar
abundances, but represent the Phoenix code development status (opacities,
cloud model) at the time of computation. The best models are therefore the
models that are the most recent i.e. computed with the most recent solar
abundance values. But you can of course run Phoenix with any of the offered
compositions using the Phoenix web simulator (http://phoenix.ens-lyon.fr/simulator).
