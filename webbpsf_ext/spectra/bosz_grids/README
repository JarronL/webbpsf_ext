BOSZ stellar atmospheres (Bohlin et al 2017).
https://archive.stsci.edu/prepds/bosz/

Wavelength values range between 1000 Angstroms to 32 microns.
Teff range from 3500K to 36000K.
metallicty from -2.25 to 0.5 in 0.25 increments
logg from 0 to 5 in 0.5 increments.

Different spectral resolutions (instrument broadening) can also be specified.
Valid res: [200, 500, 1000, 2000, 5000, 10000, 20000, 50000, 100000, 300000]
Each folder has a wget script originally used for downloading the files. 
Similar scripts can be used for different resolutions. For instance, a folder for 
R=20000  exists with a wget script to download that data from stsci (~23GB).

The `BOSZ_spectrum` and `download_BOSZ_spectrum` in spectra.py will automatically
download and populate directories with missing files.
